Book Explorer App üìö


What It Does ‚ú®
Find Books: You can type in any book title and the app will find it for you.

See Your History: It remembers the last 10 books you looked at, so you can easily go back to them.

Explore Categories: There's a section with different topics like "Science" and "Fantasy" to help you find new books.

Book Details: When you click on a book, you get to see its picture, who wrote it, and what it's about.

Cool Animations: I added some fun loading animations using something called Lottie to make the app feel more lively.

How I Built It üõ†Ô∏è
I used a bunch of cool tools to make this app:

Flutter: The main tool for building the app.

GetX: This helps the app run smoothly and keeps all the parts organized.

OpenLibrary API: This is like a giant library on the internet that gives me all the book information and pictures.

Lottie: This lets me put in cool, small animations for when the app is loading or doing something.

Cached Network Image: This makes sure the book pictures load super fast.

Shared Preferences: This helps the app remember your recently viewed books even after you close it.
